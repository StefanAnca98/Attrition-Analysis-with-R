# Attrition-Analysis-with-R
A Data Science project where I analyze a dataset about work attrition

The objective of this project will be to describe and explain how job abandonment occurs. Specifically, associations between different variables and job abandonment will be sought to describe when this occurs and to establish possible explanations for the phenomenon. Multiple techniques will be used for variable manipulation, data cleaning, data exploration, and clustering models to try to identify specific groups. The main goal is to explore the functioning of the algorithms and demonstrate ways of working with data at the time that we attempt a specific goal, rather than creating the best model. For this secondary objective, multiple iterations of different actions performed in this project may be necessary.

It is important to note that some steps in this project are designed to showcase a broad range of data science techniques, even if not all are directly interconnected or essential for the final outcome. Certain analyses were conducted to enhance understanding of the problem, and some preprocessing steps were taken to prepare the data for potential future scenarios. This approach was intentionally chosen to demonstrate a variety of data science methods and skills.
