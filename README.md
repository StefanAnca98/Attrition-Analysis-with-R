# Attrition-Analysis-with-R
A Data Science project where I analyze a dataset about work attrition

The objective of this project will be to describe and explain how job abandonment occurs. Specifically, associations between different variables and job abandonment will be sought to describe when this occurs and to establish possible explanations for the phenomenon. Multiple techniques will be used for variable manipulation, data cleaning, data exploration, and clustering models to try to identify specific groups. The main goal is to explore the functioning of the algorithms and demonstrate ways of working with data at the time that we attempt a specific goal, rather than creating the best model. For this secondary objective, multiple iterations of different actions performed in this project may be necessary.
