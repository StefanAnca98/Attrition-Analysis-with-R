## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

In this project I will keep available this Markdown file, and also the result from exporting it to HTML. The markdown file will have a plain text format, but the HTML file will have a nice formatted aspect.
